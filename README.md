# CS 181 Practicals

Hi Everyone,

Please read the following very carefully:
 
- Practicals will be distributed through this repo
- You will NOT use GitHub Classroom for practicals
- Make a standard private repo for your team. GitHub gives unlimited private repos to students. Manage your practical collaboration yourselves, without github classroom.
- The P1 directory in the above-linked repo has the assignment description, the data, and a sample notebook that implements some baselines.
- Please see the practical-logistics document for instructions on how to sign up and submit results to Kaggle and a description of what you will need to submit to Canvas.
 
Good luck and have fun!
